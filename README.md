# Today-s-Trends

# Introduction
After the discovery of the internet, everything is available in our
hands. Nowadays people don’t need to buy a hardcopy of a
newspaper in order to know what’s going on around the world. The
internet has made it possible for us to know what’s going on by
pressing some articles online. But what if there’s no need to press
anything, and your voice does the work instead? Yes, we are
proposing a project called ‘Today’s Trends’ which will provide you
with the latest news, but also save your time using voice to use the
app.

Now you may ask why using this app instead of other online
newspapers. ‘Today’s Trends’ provides a user with not only the
latest news, but also with the news from other reliable sources.
Additionally, it has a voice recognition system which will listen to your
voice and will provide you with the desired news you want. ‘Today’s
Trends’ is actually following today’s trend of being smarter than
before.

# Features
❖ Fully Responsive: The app will resize itself to preserve the user
experience and look and feel across all devices — with no irritating
zooming, scrolling or resizing, so you can use it on your cell phone or
on computer easily.

❖ Voice Search: The AI used in this app recognizes a user’s voice and
provides the user with what they want.

❖ Text-to-Speech: The AI can read out the news headlines or the news
to the user if the user requires.

❖ Latest News: The app finds out the latest news and shows it to the
user so that the user can be up-to-date.

❖ Category-wise News Section: The news on the app is divided into
categories like Business, Sports, Entertainment etc, so that the user
can easily find the category they find interesting.

❖ Term-wise News Section: The user can find a section where the
news is divided into certain terms like Bitcoin, Smartphones, America
etc, so it is easier for a user to read news regarding their favorite
terms.

❖ News from Other Sources: In this section, the user can find what
other sources are saying about a certain topic. The app will have
news from CNN, BBC etc.
